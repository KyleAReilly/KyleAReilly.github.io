									<h3>Documentation</h3>
									<p>Create Linode server
										<a href="https://www.linode.com">linode.com</a> <br />
										
										Linode is a way to create cloud based virtual machines. 
										Its important to scan your network externally. For this exercise we are using Nmap 
										which does not provide accurate vulnerability analysis from internal scans. </p>
								</header>
								<div class="image main"><img src="images/linode.png" alt="Linode Screenshot" /></div>
								<p>Step one was to install nmap using apt install nmap -y but I was getting an error saying "Unable to find package" 

									After troubleshooting, I found a forum post explaining that many packages cannot be found until the package 
									database has been updated on Linode configurations</p>
									<div class="image main"><img src="images/2-homeNetwork.png" alt="Linode Screenshot" /></div>

							
								<p>after using apt update I was able to use apt install nmap -y to install needed packages</p>
								<!-- image 3-->
								<div class="image main"><img src="images/3-homenet.png" alt="Linode Screenshot" /></div>
								<p>	Next step is using the nmap package with nmap -sT "My IP address" 
									The -sT argument enables nmap to use a tcp scan on the network
									
									nmap completed scanning and came back with this message
									
									"All 1000 scanned ports on "my IP address" are filtered"
									
									Next I rant his command - "nmap --script vuln myIP" <br/> <br/>
									This came back with the same message as before - "my IP address" are filtered"

									Compared to the source, my home network has no apparent vulnerabilities. But if it 
									did I would take some steps to protect it and harden my router. Another good option to 
									protect it is by using a VPN but it is still at risk by IoT devices

									<p>Going to the advanced > Security > Port forwarding section to check for open ports 
										I found I do not have open ports. These are considered holes in the network and its important to plug unused holes</p>
									<!-- image 5-->
									<div class="image main"><img src="images/5-homenet.png" alt="Linode Screenshot" /></div>
									<p>To maintain a secure network you need to turn off port forwarding, turn on firewall, and ensure remote management is off 
										After viewing forums, it seems spectrum routers do not give you the option to turn this off and by default it is on. 
										The solution to improve network security in this case would be using a different router with the option to turn remote access off. </p>
									<p>Another big security risk is a lot of routers use default passwords that users never change</p>
									<!-- image 6-->
									<div class="image fit"><img src="images/6-homenet.png" alt="Linode Screenshot" /></div>
									<p>I found the section to change my password in access control > user </p>
									<p>My default username was admin and password was admin. This is one security flaw I was able to fix </p>
									<p>Checking and updating firmware is a great way to keep your network up to date on known security vulnerabilities </p>
									<p>next step is to ensure a secure standard is being used on the wifi such as WPA2  or the most up to date method</p>
									<!-- image 7-->
									<div class="image fit"><img src="images/7-homenet.png" alt="Linode Screenshot" /></div>
									<p>Another security measure is to change the default password and name to protect against the threat of "wardriving" </p>
									<p>Don't give passwords even to guests. A lot of routers have options for guest users to protect your network.</p>
									<p>Disable the options to ping your network. This is to avoid scans </p>
									<p>moving on to IoT (Smart light bulbs, alexa, HVAC)</p>
									<p>a good way to protect yourself is putting IoT devices on a separate VLAN and use client isolation</p>
									<!-- image 8-->
									<div class="image main"><img src="images/8-homenet.png" alt="Linode Screenshot" /></div>
									<p>Only certain routers can use features like this
										using the software -dd-wrt you can do these things </p>
									<p></p>
									<p>Conclusion: My network was not very succeptible based on the brief overview. However, the router itself is incredibly basic and 
										is missing many security features that limit vulnerabilities. One of those vulnerabilities being an entire attack vector. IoT devices are something im 
										not able to limit vulnerabilities in as my router does not let me create seperate VLANS. Just because my network isnt very vulnerable does not mean that
										friends and families systems are the same. vulnerabilities are incredibly more likely to be found on home networks as they typically receive very limited
										user maintenance.
